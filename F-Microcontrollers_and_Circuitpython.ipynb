    "# Section F - Microcontrollers\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback: https://forms.gle/Le3RAsMEcYqEyswEA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics:** Programming microcontrollers with CircuitPython\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at circuitpython here - circuitpython is a version of micropython customized by Adafruit.  They have a ton of guides, libraries, etc available and circuitpython is the best place to start.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Circuitpython vs. Micropython vs. Standard Python\n",
    "Regular/standard pything runs as software on windows, mac, linux, etc.  It interprets code and runs it, and includes libraries like sys, os, fsutil to interact with the operating system of the computer it's running on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuitpython and Micropython are firmware (the os) that you can load onto a microcontroller like a Pi Pico or a number of newer Arduino, Esp32, and other boards. These microcontroller boards have a small amount of storage for .py files and compiled libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micropython offers some advanced features like multi-threading and has better/earlier hardware support for wifi, bluetooth, etc than Circuitpython, but it doesn't usually present a storage drive to drop code into directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuitpython has more user friendly documentation and libraries, always presents the micocontroller as a storage device, has better usb hid (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) support, and is generally easier to start with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both micropython and circuitpython present a serial console when you plug them into a computer that can be used to interact with the python prompt and see the text output from running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micropython runs \"main.py\" when it starts, and circuitpython runs \"code.py\" when it starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware test setup\n",
    "We'll practice on a pi pico microcontroller with a button, display, and accelerometer.  The pi pico has a built in LED we can blink.\n",
    "* Pi Pico: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864\n",
    "* SSD1306 OLED Display: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0837DLWVH\n",
    "* ADXL345 Accelerometer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HLP1MPY\n",
    "* Pin Reference: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4901\n",
    "* 3D printed jig: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a8ksh4/python_workshop/refs/heads/main/images/pico_proto_bracket_rev0.stl\n",
    "\n",
    "Total cost for this setup is about $8 each if you're making five of them at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adafruit has an option for USPS shipping at around $5 usually, so it's a much better place to by raspberry pi boards than amazon, but they have high pricese on some other components. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SSD1306 and ADXL345 can be found cheaper on Ali Express than amazon if you don't mind waiting a couple of weeks for shipping. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Download and install the \"Mu\" editor.  There are other options, but mu just works - it knows where to look for code on the circuitpython microcontroller and has a button to open a serial terminal. https://codewith.mu/\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash micropython onto your microcontroller board.  If you have a new board, it will present a storage device called UF2 something when you plug it into the computer. If it doesn't, then hold the boot button on the board while you plug it into the computer and it should go into uf2 flash mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download a uf2 file from circuitpython for your board**\n",
    "https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/\n",
    "https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico_w/\n",
    "And **drag the file to the UF2 storage device presented by the board**.  It'll automatically flash and reboot when you drop the file on it and present a CIRCUITPY storage device where you can modify the code.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open Mu, click the Load button, and find code.py on the CIRCUITPY drive**. Now you can modify it and each time you save a change, the board will reboot and run the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Click the Serial button to see the serial console** for any print output, error messages, and for an interactive python prompt\n",
    "* You can always press `<ctrl> + <c>` in the serial terminal to quit the running code and get an interactive prompt \">>>\"\n",
    "* You can press `<ctrl> + <d>` at the prompt to reboot teh board and run code.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Exercise:*\n",
    "* Per above, ensure you have circuitpython flashed to your board and the CIRCUITPY drive shows up when you plug it into the computer.\n",
    "* Open Mu and click the Serial button at the top to open the serial terminal. \n",
    "* Access the python terminal and run the following by typing/pasting it in.  A pretty fool-proof way reach the interactive terminal is to Press `<ctrl> + <c>`, then `<ctrl> + <d>`, and then `<ctrl> + <c>` one more time. \n",
    "  * `print('hi world!')`\n",
    "  * `import board`\n",
    "  * `dir(board)`\n",
    "* Now use Mu to open code.py on the CIRCUITPY drive.  Add a print statement that you'll recognize at the top of the file, below the import statements, and and save your change. Now press `<ctrl> + <d>` in the serial terminal to switch from the interactive prompt to running code.py and ensure that you see the result of your print statement in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in Modules\n",
    "https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of built-in modules that you can import immediately on a new board wthout copying in any additional files.  Here are a few that you're likely to use at some point:\n",
    "* alarm\n",
    "* analogio\n",
    "* board - Analog and Digital Pins, Stemma I2C\n",
    "* busio - I2C, SPI, UART (serial)\n",
    "* digitalio\n",
    "* time\n",
    "* math - sin, ..., log, pow, ... https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/math/index.html\n",
    "* ... many more... audio, camera, gc, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Just **import** these to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Libraries\n",
    "There is no pip install for circuitpython libraries. But many libraries are provided as .mpy files (micropython bytecode) in a bundle you can download here:  https://circuitpython.org/libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check the version of circuitpython on your device by restarting the board and checking output `<ctrl> + <c>`, `<ctrl> + <d>`, `<ctrl> + <c>`, or looking at the boot_out.txt on the CIRCUITPY drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're interested in the ssd1306 and adxl345 libraries - you'll find them in the library bundle inside the lib directory.  The framebuf lib is a depency of ssd1306.\n",
    "* adafruit_adxl34x.mpy\n",
    "* adafruit_ssd1306.mpy\n",
    "* adafruit_framebuf.mpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy them into your CIRCUITPY/lib directory.  When you import and start using them, they may complain about additional libraries you need to copy from the bundle."

    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "For most things here, we'll use the board library to refer to the GPIO pins and LED on our board.  E.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import board\n",
    "    >>> dir(board)\n",
    "    ['__class__', '__name__', 'A0', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'GP0', 'GP1', 'GP10', 'GP11', 'GP12', 'GP13', 'GP14', 'GP15', 'GP16', 'GP17', 'GP18', 'GP19', 'GP2', 'GP20', 'GP21', 'GP22', 'GP26', 'GP26_A0', 'GP27', 'GP27_A1', 'GP28', 'GP28_A2', 'GP3', 'GP4', 'GP5', 'GP6', 'GP7', 'GP8', 'GP9', 'LED', 'SMPS_MODE', 'STEMMA_I2C', 'VBUS_SENSE', 'VOLTAGE_MONITOR', '__dict__', 'board_id']\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also helpful to use the time library to measure elapsed time or to \"sleep\", or wait for some period of time. We can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* time.monotonic() to get the number of seconds since the board was powered up\n",
    "* time.monotonic_ns() to get the number of nanoseconds since the board was powered up\n",
    "* time.sleep(seconds) to sleep for some number of seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> import time\n",
    "    >>> time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    >>> time.monotonic()\n",
    "    47255.3\n",
    "    >>> time.monotonic_ns()\n",
    "    47260617889414\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital pins\n",
    "Digital pins can either be inputs or outputs.  An LED would be an output, or if you needed to drive a pin low/high on another device, you would use an output to do that.  An input could be a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import board\n",
    "    import digitalio\n",
    "\n",
    "    led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)\n",
    "    led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "    button = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.GP20)\n",
    "    button.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT\n",
    "    button.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP\n",
    "\n",
    "\"led\" in this example is the LED built into the Pico board. We can turn it on and off with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    led.value = True  # on\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    led.value = False  # off\n",
    "\n",
    "The button in this example has one leg wired to ground and the other leg wired to pin GP20.  We set GP20 to pull UP, so the board internally connects the pin to 3.3v through a resistor.  Whe the button is not pressed, we measure 3.3v on the pin and button.value is True.  Whe the button is pressed, it shorts the pin to ground so the voltage measured is zero (0) so button.value is False:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if not button.value:  # voltage is zero\n",
    "        print(\"button is pressed\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        #print(\"button is not pressed\")\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Exercise:*\n",
    "* Use a while loop to make the LED blink once every second.\n",
    "* Check the button and print a message when it's pressed. \n",
    "* Check the button and print a message whenever its states changes between pressed and unpressed. \n",
    "* Check the button and turn the LED on if the button is pressed, and turn it off when the button is released.  Print a message when changing the states of the LED."
