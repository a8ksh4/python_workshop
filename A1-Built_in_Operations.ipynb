    "**Topics**: Python built-in functions for:\n",
    "* Collections\n",
    "* Math\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a list of built-in functions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.  It's just an alphabetical list, and there's a lot there, so we'll try to break things into some useful categories here!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection Interaction Functions\n",
    "These groups are for creating and working with collections of things, including lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, etc!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Creation and Conversion\n",
    "We looked at the top few of these in the datatypes sections in the last notebook.  The bottom ones are more obscure...\n",
    "\n",
    "* `list()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a list.\n",
    "* `tuple()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a tuple.\n",
    "* `set()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a set.\n",
    "* `dict()`: Creates a dictionary.\n",
    "* `frozenset()`: Converts an iterable to an immutable set.\n",
    "* `bytes()`: Converts to bytes, often from a collection of integers.\n",
    "* `bytearray()`: Creates a mutable byte array from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element Access and Inspection\n",
    "Most of these do exactly what you'd expect.  Max, min, and sum require your iterator to contain numeric types.  Sorted and reverse sort and reverse the order of your collection.  Enumerate and zip are a little more complicated. There are examples for them below the following exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `len()`: Returns the number of items in a collection.\n",
    "* `max()` and `min()`: Return the maximum and minimum values in a collection.\n",
    "* `sum()`: Adds all items in a collection of numbers.\n",
    "* `sorted()`: Returns a sorted list from the items in a collection.\n",
    "* `reversed()`: Returns a reversed iterator for a collection.  Fwiw, reversed(x) is equivelant to x[::-1] in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Exercise*:\n",
    "* Try each of len, max, min, sum, sorted, reversed on the following 'some_numbers' list.  \n",
