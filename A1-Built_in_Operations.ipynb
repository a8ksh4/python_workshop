    "## Mathematical Operations\n",
    "These are the basic mathematical functoins that are included in python without importing any libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pow()`: Returns a number raised to a power.\n",
    "* `round()`: Rounds a number to a specified precision.\n",
    "* `sum()`: Adds all items in an iterable.\n",
    "* `min()` and `max()`: Return the minimum and maximum values in an iterable.\n",
    "* `divmod()`: Returns the quotient and remainder of a division.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no built in square root, but recall from math class that `sqrt(x)` is the same as `pow(x, 0.5)`, x to the 1/2 power.\n",

    "#### *Exercise*:\n",
    "Replace the ... in the following code cell using the above functions to perform the needed calculations.  Recall that the formula to calculate the hypotenuse length of a right triangle is the square root of (a squared plus b squared)."

    "These groups are for creating and working with collections of things, including lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, etc!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Creation and Conversion\n",
    "We've seen many of these already.  Aside from range(), everythong on this list can initialize a collection of some type and/or type-cast an object to the given type:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `range()`: Generates a range of numbers. \n",
    "* `list()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a list.\n",
    "* `tuple()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a tuple.\n",
    "* `set()`: Creates or converts an iterable to a set.\n",
    "* `dict()`: Creates a dictionary.\n",
    "* `frozenset()`: Converts an iterable to an immutable set.\n",
    "* `bytes()`: Converts to bytes, often from a collection of integers.\n",
    "* `bytearray()`: Creates a mutable byte array from a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection and Ordering\n",
    "Some of these do exactly what you'd expect:\n",
    "* Max, min, and sum require your iterator to contain numeric types.  \n",
    "* Sorted and reverse sort and reverse the order of your collection.  \n",
    "* Any and all are especially interested when combined with list comprehinsions.  Examples below. \n",
    "* Enumerate and zip have examples below as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the functions:\n",
    "* `len()`: Returns the number of items in a collection.\n",
    "* `max()` and `min()`: Return the maximum and minimum values in a collection.\n",
    "* `sum()`: Adds all items in a collection of numbers.\n",
    "* `all()`: Checks if all elements in a collection evaluate as True.\n",
    "* `any()`: Checks if any element in a collection is evaluate as True.\n",
    "* `sorted()`: Returns a sorted list from the items in a collection.\n",
    "* `reversed()`: Returns a reversed iterator for a collection.  Fwiw, reversed(x) is equivelant to x[::-1] in many cases.\n",
    "* `enumerate()`: Adds an index to each item in a collection, useful for loops.\n",
    "* `zip()`: Aggregates elements from multiple collections into tuples, useful for creating dictoinaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Exercise*:\n",
    "* Try each of len, max, min, sum, sorted, reversed on the following 'some_numbers' list.  \n",
    "* Compute the average of some_numbers using len and sum:"
