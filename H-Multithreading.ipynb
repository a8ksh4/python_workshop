    "Differences between processes and threads\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "Multi-threading enables us to do more than one thing at the same time.  One multi-core CPUs, threads can occupy more than one core and both perform work concurrently.  Even on a single core, threads can take turns running so that if one thread is waiting for a response (network, user input, disk read, etc) another thread can still be productive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "* Single thread (a process with a single thread)\n",
    "* Multiple threads (a process with multiple threads)\n",
    "* Multiple processes (multiple processes each having one or more threads)\n",
    "* Single thread using asyncio (library enabling single thread to manage multiple io-bound tasks consurrenty)\n",
    "* Stackless python - uses greenlets (like threads in a thread) to manage multiple tasks pseudo-concurrently like asyncio.\n",
    "* Native Libraries that handle concurrency on their own - numpy, pytorch, etc\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Reasons for needing threading/concurrency\n",
    "* Performance - get things done faster\n",
    "  * Avoid doing nothing while waiting for a long io bound operation to complete\n",
    "* Responsiveness - one thread can check for user input while other threads do the work efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitfalls of threading\n",
    "* Python GIL limits actuall parallelism and limits performance.\n",
    "  * Use multiprocessing or native extensions (e.g., NumPy, PyTorch) for parallel computation.\n",
    "* Race Conditions - Multiple threads try to use the same resources at the same time.\n",
    "  * Use threading.Lock() or higher-level synchronization primitives.\n",
    "* Deadlocks - if threads don't release resources then work in other threads can be blocked.\n",
    "  * Prefer context managers (with lock:) over lock.acquire() / lock.release() manually\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threading library \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new thread**\n",
    "Pass it the functiion that it will execute and the arguments to pass to the function\n",

    "    print(\"Thread is still running...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**End the thread**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "We need to take precautions to avoid reading/changing memory at the same time between threads using locks and/or mutexes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lock = threading.Lock()\n",
    "...\n",

    "    do_something_with_shared_resource()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processes vs threads\n",
    "Processes are allocated by the operating system and have their own protected memory.  It is expensive to create and destroy processes and sharing data between processes is difficult. Eace process can start multiple threads that all share the process' memory, so threads can communicate, e.g. worker threads can take turns retreiving tasks from a queue in \"shared memory\" to work on them in parallel.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the GIL?\n",
    "The GIL - Global Interpreter Lock - is a sort of mutex that only lets one thread execute at a time. Python was designed using the gil initially to make the language more simple and maintainable and to focus on single threaded performance.  Many python programs are slowed more by I/O wait than cpu and don't see performance penalty from the gil. \n",
    "\n",
    "Work is ongoing now to remove the gil, and even standard python can be compiled now without it if you have need for truly concurrent multi-threading with python.  Just note that some libraries are not thread safe or not yet updated to work without the gil.  \n",

    "Let's create two threads that each execute the worker function.  \n",
    "* threading.Thread returns a handle for a new thread\n",
    "  * target= specifies the function it will run\n",
    "  * args= specifies any arguments that should be passed to the function\n",
    "* t.start() tells the thread to start running.\n",
