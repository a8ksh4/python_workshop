    "Everything in python is an object, and creating a class is how we define a new type object.  We can encapsulate any behavior and data into a class that we want, and classes can inherit other classes in order to expand on their functionality. \n",

    "This is a classic example.  We are at a school and need to keep records of people at the school.  There are properties that all people have and properties that only specific people, students, teachers, administrators, will have.  So weu can create a generic people class and inherit that into separate student and teacher classes.  "
