    "## About Python\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language - you don't have to compile your code before running it.  It's disigned to be readable and maintainable, and to do a lot of tasks efficiently.   It's one of the most popular languages for good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not run as fast as a compiled language like c, c++, fortran, but it has a lot of libraries that are written in c and make specific tasks very fast.  We'll work with pandas later in this class.  Pandas is built on numpy, a very performant library for manipulating lots of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What can we do with Python?\n",
    "* Machine learning - Look into \"SciPy\" and many other libraries that make ML simple-ish to use.\n",
    "* Analytics and data processing - find trends, do analysis, make graphs!\n",
    "* Automate the boring stuff - office tasks like mail merges, filling out document templates over and over, processing spreadsheet and data\n",
    "* Web scraping - Look into BeautifulSoup or many other libraries\n",
    "* Embeded systems and Robotics - look at micropython and circuitpython, which run on many small microconrtollers\n",
    "* Games - Look into PyGame, Pygame Zero, Turtle, or even Godot engine, which uses a python-like language and can build very advanced games. \n",
    "* Systems automation - read config files, run commands on computers, collect data, do stuff.  \n",
    "* And more!\n",

    "## Syntax\n",
    "Reference this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "Some words cannot be used as variables because they have special meaning in the python language:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    and as assert async await break case class continue \n",
    "    def del elif else except False finally for from global \n",
    "    if import in is lambda match None nonlocal not or pass \n",
    "    raise return True try while with yield _.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Python uses indentation to group code inside of functions, classes, and control blocks. Other languages often use { } for the same purpose.\n",
    "* Be consistent with your indentation.  \n",
    "* **Four spaces per indentation level** is recommended. It can be hard to see which code aligns with which above it when using only two spaces per indentation level.\n",
    "* Many editors can be configured to intent four spaces each time you press the tab key.  \n",
    "* Technically you can use tab characters or any number of spaces per indentaton level. Above all, **be consistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example function named \"foo\" that has an if else condition block inside of it.  Everything indented after the def line is part of the function, and the lines after the if and else blocks each have additional indentation. When the indentation ends, the block ends. \n",
    "\n",
    "    def foo(x):\n",
    "        if x > 9000:\n",
    "            print(\"x is big!\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"x is small!\")\n",
    "        print(\"This is in the function.  We checked if x is big.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"This print statement is outside of the function.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "An equivelant function in c could be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    void foo(int x)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if (x > 9000) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    print(\"This print statement is outside of the function.\");\n",
    "\n",
    "The indentation in c code is functionally unnecessary, but makes it readable.  The { and } group the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoting\n",
    "Strings, non-numeric values, are quoted with ', \", ''', \"\"\".  We'll look at this more in the strings section below.  Just note this.  Variable names are not quoted, but values when assigned or passed as arguments to a function are if they are to be treated as strings.  \n",
