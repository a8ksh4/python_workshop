    "\n",
    "**Topics** - Python Editors, Writing and runnig scripts, argparse library\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been working in python notebooks - these are great for workflows or data centered presentations where you want to mix text, code, and graphs/plots and a human will be interacting with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But some times we want to make a tool that we can run, maybe part of an automated process, and don't want to see the code to do it.  We can write a script - a text file that the python interpreter runs for us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Script** vs **Program** - call it what you want.  Calling something a program implies that it's compiled, or at least that its more complicated than a script.  Python works just as well for short utility scripts as for gigantic programs, but it's not really\n",
    "\\* compiled. In computationaly intensive programs, you might write moudles in C or or another compiled language to handle the cpu-heavy tasks, and call those modules from python, keeping all of the complex program logic in python so that it's more human friendly to work on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* *When you run a python .py script, it is converted to a .pyc bytecode file which is executed by the interpreted.  The bytecode is obfuscated, but is trivial to convert back to python code, unlike a truely compiled language.  sometimes you'll see people/companies distribute .pyc files to obfuscate their tools somewhat.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "You need to have a python interpreter installed on your computer in order to run a python script. You should **select the option during install to add the interpreter to the system PATH** so that when you open up a cmd or powershell window, you can directly run a .py file with \"python3\" in the shebang line and it just runs, or you can say \"pyhon my_script.py\" and python is in your path so it just works. \n",

    "## Python Editors (IDEs)\n",
    "It's important to use a good editor for writing scripts.  Some features of a good editor include:\n",
    "* Syntax highlighting\n",
    "* Linting - A Linter is a tool that looks at your code for issues like missing variables, misspelled stuff, and any time you diverge from standards and conventions that the rest of the world thinks are a good idea. \n",
    "* You make like for your ide to be able to run your code from the editor and give you the output.  Or you may prefer to run it from a terminal window separately. \n",
    "* Debugging - If you run your code from the editor, you should be able to set breakpoints to pause your script and see what variables are set, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few good ones are:\n",
    "* VS Code\n",
    "* IntelliJ or PyCharm\n",
    "* Atom\n",
    "* Sublime\n",
    "* VIM, NeoVIM, or Emacs (there are more of a Linux thing)"

Windows might pop up a windows store page to instal python.  That'll probably work. Install python if you need to and get this working. \n",
    "\n",
    "Install an IDE - I recommend VS Code, but use what you want. The instructions here will all be for VS Code. once installed, go into the extensions menu and search for \"python microsoft\".  Install the \"python\", \"Pylance\", \"Pylint\", \"autopep8\" extensions specifically from microsoft.  You may also like the \"Jupyter\" extension for notebooks. \"Copilot\" is great too, but requires signing up for it at github.com. \n",

    "Make a folder in your home directory for python scripts and open that folder with Code. Use the exploror winodw pane on the left to create a new file caled hello.py.  Add the following to the file and save it (ctrl+s is a shortcut to save):\n",

    "We can run it from the IDE too.  Use the little triangle in the top right corner of the window to run it and you should see a console pop up on the bottom showing the hello world message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you have any hilighted lines in the script indicating issues, try to resolve them.  For example, I see, \"Missing module docstring\" and \"Final newline missing\".  A module docstring is a tripple quoted string at the top of the file, just below the shebang line, that says what the file/module does.  For example:\n",

    "## Argparse\n",
    "The previous exercise hopefully proved that we can simply pass data into a script and check for it, but a really high quality script is able to also provide documentaion about what it does, what arguments are allowed, verify that correct arguments are given and that the values set with them are valid, and return them all in a simple data structure that can be used by the script.  It would require a lot of code to do this ourselves, so thankfully we have the \"argparse\" library.  \n",
