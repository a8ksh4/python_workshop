    "We use functions for a few things:\n",
    "* Reduce dupliation in code - use the same function in multiple places in your code.\n",
    "* Simplify code - breaking down complex code into smaller, separate, problems make the entire code more managable and maintainable. \n",
    "* Readability - named functions say specifically what they're going to do, so our program is less cluttered and easier to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "A note about programming in notebooks like this... breaking code up into cells helps to organize it like a function might in a script.  And the most improvemint I've seen in notbooks on duplicated code is by organizing data into dictionaries and using loops to work on each group of data one at a time.  Functions are very important when writing scripts and larger programs, but a little less so in notebooks, except that when we import libraries, we call functions in the librar"

    "### Scope\n",
    "This is a new concept for us - there are certain places where variables can be defined that they will be unaccessible externally.  The variables have a specific scope in which they can be used. \n",
    "* **Global** - variables defined outside of functinos, classes, etc, in your program are accessible from everywhere. However, it's bad practice to use global variables from inside of functions as it makes it hard to follow what data is used by the function.  Side effects can be introduced.\n",
    "* **Functions** - variables defined inside of functions are not visible outside of the function.  This means we don't neeed to worry about accidentally using a variable from a(nother) function when we don't mean to. \n",
    "* **Classes/Objects** - objects (instances of a class) have thier own variables/properties and functions that aren't accessible externally.\n",
    "* **Modules** - modules imported like, \"import pandas\", have their own scope inside of \"pandas\" that we access via the module name, like \"pandas.DataFrame\".  If we were to do \"from pandas import *\", then all things in the pandas namespace would be populated into our global namespace and we could directly access DataFrame.  This can introduce problems, e.g., if multiple modules have things with the same name inside of them. It's better to import specific things to our global namespace if wanted... \"from pandas import DataFrame\" will only add the DataFrame class to our global namespace.\n",
    "* And a few other places.  Try except blocks, inside of list comprehensions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means to us with regard to functions is that we should pass data the function needs in as arguments, create any variables in the function that we need without worrying about them polluting the namespace of our greater program, and then return the important data from the function with a return call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Exercise*\n",
    "Let's investigate the nuances of global and local variables in a function.  Do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run the cell below and not the values of x inside and outside of the function.\n",
    "* Uncomment the x=3 line and see what changes\n",
    "* Uncomment the global declaration in the function ans run it again to see what changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, x only exists in the global namespace, so when we call print, python finds it there. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we uncomment the x=3, we define x in the function's local namespace, so that is what gets printed.  The function's namespace will always be used before the global namespace. Note that we don't overwrite the global namespace x value when we set x in the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we uncomment the global line, we are declaring that the x in the function is in the global namespace, so when we set x=3, we are able to change the global x.  There are times when this is useful, but in general we should try not to do this because it makes it harder to debug code and hides interaction between stuff.  We should pass data the function needs in as arguments. "

    "* **Data analysis and math**\n",
    "  * pandas - Manipulate structured data in DataFrames.  Built on numpy.  Sort of like excel but less tedious. \n",
    "  * matplotlib - Data visualization tool.  We use it to generate axis and subplots for more interesting plots. \n",
    "  * seaborn - Advanced data visualization and analysis tools.  \n",
    "  * numpy - Work with arrays of data.  Vectorize data operations for performance. \n",
    "  * math - Trig functions, sqrt, etc. Used for individual values.  x = math.tan(y)\n",
    "  * datetime - Convert string data to datetime objects and vice-versa.  Perform time operations, like adding hours, days, etc. \n",
    "* **OS and file handing**\n",
    "  * sys - Access environment variables, \"exit\", get system information.\n",
    "  * os - List files (os.listdir), modify permissions, filesystem stats, user account stuff. \n",
    "  * shutil - Helper funcions for moving and copying files, few other things.\n",
    "  * tar, zip - Open or create zip and tar archive files with these. tar is more common on linux systems. \n",
    "  * subprocess - Execute programs or commands outside of python.\n",
    "* **Data encapsulation and databases...**\n",
    "  * json - Structured text format of the web and many things. Use format=\"pretty\"\n",
    "  * yaml - Like json, but more friedly for humans to edit the files.  More flexible allowing in line comments in the file.\n",
    "  * pickle - pickle and unpickle nearly any python object to save in a file. \n",
    "  * sqlite3 - file based database\n",
    "  * mysql - open source mysql database connections...\n",
    "  * pyodbc - odbc based database connections\n",
    "* **Network stuff**\n",
    "  * requests - talk to web servers\n",
