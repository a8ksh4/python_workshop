    "The built-in pandas plotting is based on matplotlib by default and gives a simple inteface to make a lot of plot types. You'll notice that there are a couple of variations of the plot commands that work fairly interchangably:\n",
    "* `df.plot.box(by='dayofyear')`\n",
    "* `df.plot(kind='box', by='dayofyear')`\n",
    "* `df.boxplot(by='dayofyear')`\n",
    "\n",
    "df.plot.box and df.plot(kind='box') are equivelant and use the pandas plot wrapper to call plt.boxplot. df.boxplot is a more direct call to plt.boxplot - and not all plot types have this call available directly in the dataframe. In any case, you'll notice that plt.box and plt.boxplot don't have a \"by\" argument.  There's a bit of code in the pandas wrapper that the above three meuthods use to groupby the data for you. There's a comparison with the plt.box function in the boxplot example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot function built into the Pandas DataFrame object works with matplotlib to generate plots for you using a few standard arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **data** is the dataframe object to work on.  If you call df.plot, this is implied, and if you call pd.DataFrame.plot(data=df, ...) it must be given as an argument. \n",
    "* **x** is a label or position, defaulting to None.\n",
    "* **y** is a label, position, or list of balel, positions, defaulting to None.\n",
    "* **kind** is the type of plot to make:  line, bar, hist, scatter, etc...  \n",
    "\n",
    "As well as a bunch of more detailed options for the plot axis, subplots, style options etc.  Read over the documintation for a few min to see what options are available: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html\n",
